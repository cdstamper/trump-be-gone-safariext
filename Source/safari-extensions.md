# Quick Intro

Safari extensions are really simple.

They need to be signed using a Safari Developer certificate, so if you're going to be packaging it yourself you'll need an Apple Developer account.

El Capitan or newer is requried for Content Blockers. Make sure you enable the Developer options in Safari. From there it's as simple as Menu->Develop->Show Extension Builder
