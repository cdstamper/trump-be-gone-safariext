## Safari Extension - Content Blocker

### You need to know what's happening. You don't need to see his face.

Trump-Be-Gone is a simple Safari Content Blocker extension which blocks media from loading if the URL matches a very simple regex.

It's not perfect but it certainly will reduce the number of times you have to see the orange man.

You can test by navigating to [Getty Images] (http://www.gettyimages.com/photos/trump) - most of the images should be blocked.

This is a not-for-profit project, feel free to submit pull requests to improve the regex. An iOS version is on the way, if Apple approves it!
