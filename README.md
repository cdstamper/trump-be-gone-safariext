## Hide Trump Images from Safari

**You need to know what's happening. You don't need to see his face.**

Trump-Be-Gone is a simple Safari Content Blocker extension which blocks all media from loading if the URL contains the keyword "trump".

It's not perfect but it certainly will reduce the number of times you have to see him.

You can test by navigating to [Getty Images] (http://www.gettyimages.com/photos/trump) - most of the images should be blocked.

## Privacy

Safari content blockers are simply regular expressions (in json) that Safari uses to intellegently block content. They don't have access to your personal information including pages visited, or even web page content.

## Contributing
This is of course a not-for-profit project, please submit pull requests to improve the regex. An iOS version is on the way, if Apple approves it, which will also be open-sourced.
